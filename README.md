# Digits
The MNIST Digits dataset has been used for training which consists of handwritten grayscale digits images from 0 to 9 of size 28x28. As the task is given to classify a given image of the digit to respective classes by using Convolutional Neural Network. The network consists of two Convolutional Layer along with two corresponding pooling layer. The convolutional layer is used to distinguish the different aspects of the image and the corresponding pooling layer is used to reduce the spatial size of the image thus enhancing the features of the image. After the reduction of image size, dense layer consisting of 128 neurons are used to classify the features of images along with another dense layer consisting of 10 neurons to identify the image from 0 to 9.
